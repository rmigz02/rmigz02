Makin' repositories soon:

-> Softwares dedicated to take back control of your Android device (and your dopamine responses too ü§£) when you feel like it "goes out of control"

-> Some Android Debug Bridge based tools with a GUI for those who use repetitive ADB commands

-> A growing list of considerable "Android bloat" package names and optional and safe to uninstall Android system packages that comes with further information that help you decide whether to keep a package installed or not considering its trade-offs in functionality

-> Test Arduino softwares for some useless sorts of automation but educational and a useful basis (like a bot for dodging the obstacles in T-Rex dinosaur game ü§£)

-> Short ManimCE projects! Short python scripts that allow ManimCE beginners to kickstart their learning ‚ù§Ô∏è
